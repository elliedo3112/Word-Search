Skills Involved
###Problem-Solving and Logical Thinking###
The word search problem requires breaking it down into small, manageable tasks. This includes iterating over the grid, checking neighboring cells, and determining boundaries to ensure that the word fits within the grid limits.

###Algorithm Design###
Efficient search algorithms are implemented to minimize redundant checks. The search process is optimized by scanning multiple directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) at once and verifying that the word matches the grid pattern.

###Data Structures###
A 2D array or grid is used to represent the word search puzzle, enabling systematic access to each character in the grid. Directional offsets are stored in arrays or maps, which makes it easier to iterate and check all potential directions.

###Programming Constructs###
The program makes use of loops, particularly nested for loops, to traverse through the grid. Conditional statements (if statements) are used to validate whether the word matches and ensures the search stays within grid boundaries.

###Grid-Based Thinking###
Mapping the word's placement to indices in the grid is a key part of the solution. This involves calculating the next positions in the grid using directional logic to ensure that the word matches in a particular direction.

###Modular Design###
The program benefits from a modular design where helper methods are used to improve code readability and reusability. Methods like findStartPoint() or searchInDirection() are designed to handle specific tasks and can be reused across different parts of the program.

###Return Value Formatting###
The output is structured as a standard array [row, column, direction], which provides a clear, consistent format for returning the result of the word search, whether the word is found or not. This ensures the output is easy to interpret and use in other parts of the program.
