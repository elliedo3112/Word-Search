# Word Search Project

## Skills Involved

### 1. Problem-Solving and Logical Thinking
The word search problem is broken down into smaller, manageable tasks. These tasks include iterating over the grid, checking neighboring cells, and determining boundaries to ensure the word fits within the grid limits.

### 2. Algorithm Design
Efficient search algorithms are implemented to minimize redundant checks. The search process is optimized by scanning multiple directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) at once, verifying that the word matches the grid pattern.

### 3. Data Structures
A 2D array or grid is used to represent the word search puzzle, enabling systematic access to each character in the grid. Directional offsets are stored in arrays or maps for easier iteration and checking all potential directions.

### 4. Programming Constructs
The program uses loops (nested `for` loops) to traverse through the grid. Conditional statements (`if` statements) are applied to validate whether the word matches, ensuring the search stays within grid boundaries.

### 5. Grid-Based Thinking
Mapping the wordâ€™s placement to indices in the grid is a key part of the solution. This involves calculating the next positions in the grid using directional logic to ensure that the word matches in the chosen direction.

### 6. Modular Design
The program uses modular design with helper methods like `findStartPoint()` and `searchInDirection()` to improve code readability and reusability. These methods handle specific tasks and can be reused across different parts of the program.

### 7. Return Value Formatting
The output is structured as a standard array `[row, column, direction]` to provide a clear, consistent result. This format ensures the word search output is easy to interpret and use in other parts of the program.
